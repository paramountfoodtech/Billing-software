### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd BillingManagementSystem
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Set Up Supabase

1. Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Go to Project Settings > API
3. Copy your project URL and anon key

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory (see `.env.example` for reference):

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key-here

# Application URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Email Configuration (Resend)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_resend_api_key
EMAIL_FROM=your-verified-email@yourdomain.com
```

**Email Setup (Required for notifications):**
1. Sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Get your API key from the [API Keys page](https://resend.com/api-keys)
3. Verify your sending domain (or use `onboarding@resend.dev` for testing)
4. Add the credentials to your `.env.local` file

### 5. Set Up the Database

In your Supabase project, go to the SQL Editor and run these scripts **in order**:

1. `scripts/001_create_tables.sql` - Creates all tables and basic structure
2. `scripts/005_complete_rls_fix.sql` - Sets up Row Level Security policies
3. `scripts/006_add_organizations.sql` - Adds multi-tenancy support
4. `scripts/008_add_client_pricing.sql` - Adds client-specific pricing functionality
5. `scripts/009_simplify_roles.sql` - **NEW** Simplifies to admin and accountant roles only

```sql
-- Copy and paste each script into the SQL Editor and execute
```

### 6. Run the Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### 7. Create Your First Admin User

**IMPORTANT**: The first user must be created manually in Supabase to become an admin.

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
2. Click "Add user" → "Create new user"
3. Enter email and password
4. After creating, go to SQL Editor and run:
```sql
-- Replace 'USER_EMAIL_HERE' with the email you just created
UPDATE public.profiles 
SET role = 'admin' 
WHERE email = 'USER_EMAIL_HERE';
```
5. Now login with this admin account
6. Admins can create more users (accountants) from the dashboard

**After first admin is created:**
- Public signup is disabled for security
- Only admins can create new accountant users via `/dashboard/users/new`
